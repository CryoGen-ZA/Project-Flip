# Project-Flip

In the project you will find a basic card match game.

This project is created in UNITY 2021 LTS, Its made with the built in render pipeline.
Everything in the project is made from scratch so no additional packages are needed.

This includes the visuals, only the audio is sourced from freesound.org, but they are CC0 so no creditation is required.

Core Features:
-Card generation and shuffling, no predefined game objects
-Matching functionality
-Serialization and Deserialization of matches for save and load functionality
-Audio cues played when matching, mismatching and finishing a game
-Scoring system

Additional Features:
-Menu system (Main menu, Result screen, Pause screen and a Layout selection screen)
-Randomized card theme, currently there is only two themes, but its designed to easily add more with only a scriptable object setup
-Combo System

Additional notes:

I tried to keep the code as clean and easy to follow as possible with the naming as descriptive as possible.
For this reason, there is not many comments in the code nor is there any XML function descriptions.
